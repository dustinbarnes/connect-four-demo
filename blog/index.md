# Connect Four Demo Project

I need/want a project that can highlight some of my skills and expertise. Since most of my work is non-public, it can be a struggle to find that sweet spot of having enough complexity, but not too much. 

After some deliberation, I figured a web-based connect-four style game can do this. I can highlight the primary components of building a service that can scale -- a Java/Spring Boot backend, a Vite/React frontend, a Playwright e2e test suite, and an API-first approach. The build and structure of this application is mildly obtuse so that it mimics some of the real-world pains of projects at scale.
